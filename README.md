# PyTorch and Deep Learning Fundamentals

## What is Deep Learning?
Machine learning involves converting data into numerical values and identifying patterns within those values.

- Finding Patterns: This task is handled by computers using code and mathematical methods.

## Why Use Machine Learning (or Deep Learning)?

- Good Reason: Why not?
- Better Reason: Can you enumerate all the rules for a complex problem?

## What Deep Learning is Good For

- Dealing with Problems involving Long Lists of Rules: When traditional approaches fail, machine learning and deep learning can be helpful.
- Adapting to Continually Changing Environments: Deep learning can learn and adjust to new scenarios.
- Discovering Insights within Large Data Collections: Imagine manually crafting rules for recognizing 101 different types of food.

## What Deep Learning is Not Good For

- Lack of Explainability: Patterns learned by deep learning models are often incomprehensible to humans.
- Better Suitability of Traditional Approaches: If a simple rule-based system can solve your problem effectively.
- Unacceptability of Errors: Deep learning model outputs can be unpredictable.
- Insufficient Data: Deep learning models generally require substantial amounts of data for optimal results.

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

**Machine Learning (often called "shallow algorithms"):**
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosted Models
- Naive Bayes
- Nearest Neighbour
- Support Vector Machine
- ...many more

**Deep Learning (common algorithms):**
- Neural Networks
- Fully Connected Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Recurrent Neural Network
- Transformer

## Focused Areas of Development with PyTorch

- Neural Networks
- Fully Connected Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network

## What are Neural Networks?

Inputs → Numerical Encoding → Learns Representation (Patterns/Features/Weights) → Representation Outputs → Output
(Before using data with a neural network, it must be converted into numerical values, i.e., Numerical Encoding)

## Types of Learning

- Supervised Learning: Data and Labels
- Unsupervised & Self-supervised Learning
- Transfer Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
